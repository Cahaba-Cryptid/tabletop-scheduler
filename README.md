#RPG Scheduler

##Details
RPG Scheduler is my personal way to have friends schedule sessions for D&D. It allows anyone who has the web address to sign up for an account and submit requests for sessions which they want me to DM for. This version is simple, only allowing users to submit dates and small notes about the other players they wish to play with.
